<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">C</span>rimson clover is a handsome fall-planted
annual, widely cultivated in the Middle Atlantic
and Southeastern States for forage, a cover crop,
and green manure.</p>

<p>Crimson clover is commonly sown in corn at the
last cultivation. If the soil is heavy, a better practice
is to sow after a crop of small grain or on other land
which can be specially prepared.</p>

<p>Crimson clover will grow on poorer soil than most
clovers and is not particularly dependent upon lime.
For this reason it has been widely used for restoring
the productivity of soils which have been abused. A
more important function is to maintain crop yields
on soils which are already moderately rich.</p>

<p>The most common difficulty in growing crimson
clover is the killing of the young stands by drought.
This is best prevented by the preparation of a fine,
moist, and firmly compacted seed bed.</p>

<p>August and September are the best months for
sowing crimson clover, the exact date depending
upon the condition of the soil. Either hulled or unhulled
seed may be used, the latter giving somewhat
greater certainty of a stand.</p>

<p>Crimson clover is often sown with a nurse crop of
buckwheat or cowpeas, to protect it from the sun.
A light covering of straw is also effective.</p>

<p>Combinations of crimson clover with oats, hairy
vetch, or other fall-sown forage crops give somewhat
higher yields and a surer stand than crimson clover
alone.</p>

<p>No insects trouble crimson clover seriously, and
the only severe disease is the stem-rot, or wilt.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">C</span>rimson clover is an annual or winter annual true clover,
resembling common red clover in size and general appearance,
the most noticeable difference being the flower heads, which are long,
narrow, and pointed instead of short, spherical, and compact (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).
The individual flowers of this clover are commonly of a rich scarlet
color, and as the heads are borne mostly on the ends of the stems,
a field of crimson clover in full bloom presents a strikingly brilliant
appearance. Because of the color of the flowers, crimson clover is
often termed "scarlet clover," although it is also known, less commonly,
as "French clover," "Italian clover," "German clover," "incarnate
clover," and "annual clover." It is the only annual true
clover that is of more than incidental agricultural importance in
the eastern United States.</p>

<p>Probably the most important characteristic of crimson clover is
its ability to grow and make its crop during the fall and early spring,
when the land is not occupied by the ordinary summer-grown crops.
In sections where it succeeds, it can be sown following a grain crop
or in an intertilled crop in late summer and is ready to harvest for
hay, to pasture, or to turn under as green manure in time to plow
the land for spring-seeded crops, such as corn or cotton. South of
central Delaware it may even be cut for seed and the stubble plowed
under in time for seeding a quick-maturing strain of corn. Because
it can be grown during the offseason of the year, crimson clover
is one of the most economical legumes for green manuring, and it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[ 4 ]</a></span>
been largely used for that purpose in the regions to which it is
adapted. The many uses to which this crop may be put merit a careful
study of the best methods of establishing a stand of this clover on
the farm.</p>

<h2><a id="HISTORY_AND_ADAPTATIONS"></a>HISTORY AND ADAPTATIONS.</h2>

<p>Crimson clover is a native of Europe, where it is cultivated as a
forage and green-manuring crop in Italy, France, Spain, Germany,
Austria, and Great Britain. Large quantities of crimson-clover seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[ 5 ]</a></span>
are exported from Europe to the United States, especially from the
districts of central France, where crimson clover is the premier leguminous
forage plant.</p>

<p>Crimson clover was introduced into this country as early as 1818,
and the seed was widely distributed by the United States Patent
Office in 1855. The plant was at first regarded more for its ornamental
value than as a forage plant, however, and it was not until
about 1880 that its value for agricultural purposes began to be
appreciated.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 310px;"><a id="fig2"></a>
<img src="images/fig2.png" width="310" height="293" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Map of a part of the United States, showing the
region where crimson clover is most widely grown.</div>
</div>

<p>At present crimson clover is grown most widely in the lighter sandy
areas of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, where the soil is not very rich
and the winters are not severe. (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2.</a>) The plant does not withstand
either extreme
cold or extreme heat,
and its culture is
therefore limited to
regions which enjoy
at some time during
the year a long period
of relatively
mild, moist weather.
Ordinarily, this
clover does not survive
the winter in
latitudes north of
southern Pennsylvania,
while in some
of the Southern
States it is frequently
killed by dry, hot
weather in the fall
or spring. It succeeds well in the humid regions near the Gulf of
Mexico and in the Pacific Northwest, but in these areas it is not
widely grown.</p>

<p>Normally, crimson clover is a winter annual comparable to winter
wheat; that is, it is planted in the fall, lies more or less dormant
over winter, grows rapidly in the spring, and dies, after going to seed,
early in the summer. Where the summers are not too hot it can be
planted in the spring and grown as a summer crop, but for this purpose
other clovers are usually preferred.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="VARIETIES" id="VARIETIES">VARIETIES.</a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover is exceedingly variable both in color of flower and
in time of maturity. These variations are particularly noticeable in
fields planted from a mixed lot of seed, the flowers presenting a
range in color from nearly pure white to a deep purplish red and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6 ]</a></span>
seeds a difference in date of ripening of more than a month. Since
crimson clover is thought to be mainly self-pollinated, it is easy to
fix these qualities by selection and to establish definite varieties.</p>

<p>In Europe six or seven different varieties of crimson clover are
recognized and sold by seedsmen, varying from extra early crimson
flowered to, extra late white flowered and from very hardy to non-hardy.
By the use of a succession of these varieties the European
farmer is able to spread his harvest over six or seven weeks instead of
having it concentrated within a few days, as in America. Similarly,
the culture of the plant has been extended northward from Italy to
Sweden by means of hardy strains. A wild form of crimson clover
having yellowish flowers and hairy foliage occurs in southern and
eastern Europe and in England, but it is not of economic value.</p>

<p>In America no sharply defined varieties of crimson clover are recognized,
except a white-blooming variety which is sold in the South
and is two weeks later than the ordinary crimson-flowered sort.
Hardy strains have been developed and used in a small way in
Massachusetts and Ohio, but these are not commercially available.</p>

<h3><a id="SEEDING_IN_INTERTILLED_CROPS"></a>SEEDING IN INTERTILLED CROPS.</h3>

<p>In former years a large percentage of the crimson-clover acreage
was seeded in corn or other intertilled crops at or shortly after the
time of the last cultivation. In most of the crimson-clover area it
is possible to make such a seeding, obtain a good growth during the
fall and early spring, and mow or plow under the clover in time, for
breaking up the land for another crop of corn. This has been the
standard method of growing this clover, and it is still the leading
practice in many of the older sections. Corn in the summer with
crimson clover in the winter is a cheap and convenient method of
growing a cash crop and a restorative crop the same year, and the
reputation of crimson clover as a crop increaser is largely based on
this simple rotation. Instances are by no means rare where the yield
of corn has been gradually increased from 10 bushels per acre to as
high as 70 bushels by this means.</p>

<p>The difficulty with this method is the possibility of the stand of
young clover failing through drought. The growing corn makes a
heavy demand on the soil moisture, and if there is not enough moisture
for both clover and corn the latter gets the larger share and the
tender clover plants are likely to succumb. Because of the risk
involved, farmers in the upland sections are seeking other and more
reliable methods of seeding, and the sowing of crimson clover in
corn is gradually decreasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[ 7 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the danger from fall drought is not serious, crimson clover
may be sown in corn at the time of the last cultivation or when the
corn leaves have just begun to wither. South of central Virginia
there is likely to be much hot weather after the corn is laid by, in
which case it is best to delay the seeding of the clover until after
the first rain. The appearance of a field of crimson clover seeded in
corn the previous summer is shown in <a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 462px;"><a id="fig3"></a>
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="462" height="280" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Crimson clover in an old cornfield. The clover was seeded in the corn at the
last cultivation. A fodder stack is to be observed in the middle foreground. The
cornstalks have been removed to avoid difficulty in mowing the clover.</div>
</div>

<p>South of southern Virginia crimson clover can be seeded in cotton,
provided the field is free from crab-grass and other weeds and the
soil is not too dry. In the extreme north of the cotton belt the seed
may be sown at the last working of the cotton; farther south this
occurs too early and it is necessary to wait for a rain, which often
comes at about the time of the first picking.</p>

<p>Crimson clover may be seeded in practically any of the cultivated
truck crops which receive their last cultivation from 8 to 12 weeks
before the first frost. It is not practicable to seed the clover in late
potatoes, sweet potatoes, or other root crops, as the digging in the
fall practically destroys the clover.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, crimson clover does not succeed when sown in cowpeas,
sorghum, or watermelons, owing to the heavy shade cast by
these crops. It can, however, be seeded in tobacco, tomatoes, cultivated
soy beans, and cantaloupes.</p>


<h3><a id="SEEDING_AFTER"></a>SEEDING AFTER AN EARLY-MATURING CROP.</h3>

<p>Seeding crimson clover in an intertilled crop is successful mostly
on sandy soils, which can easily be prepared for seeding even in mid-summer.
On clay soils and in weedy fields this method of seeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8 ]</a></span>
is likely to be unsatisfactory. Such soils are usually hard and dry
in August and can with difficulty be brought into condition for a
seed bed, with the result that a large percentage of such seedings
fail. A better plan on clay soils, and on sandy soils in many cases,
is to seed the crimson clover on specially prepared ground from
which all other crops have been removed. Such ground can be
made as fine and firm as desired. Furthermore, the clover after
planting does not have to compete with another crop for the soil
moisture. This method is somewhat more troublesome than planting
in intertilled crops, but the greater certainty of getting a stand
more than offsets the greater cost. Planting crimson clover on
specially prepared ground has extended the culture of the plant
to regions where it was not hitherto grown and is increasing the
reliability of the crop in sections where it has been long established.</p>

<p>In the ordinary rotation, crimson clover follows a crop of small
grain. However, it may follow any crop that is removed 8 to 10
weeks before frost, or it may be seeded on fallow ground. Ground
from which early potatoes have been removed is especially favorable
for the establishment of a stand of this clover. The residual
effect of the fertilizers used on potatoes is partially responsible for
this, while the well-settled seed bed, which requires only leveling
and harrowing, also presents favorable conditions for the crimson-clover
seedlings.</p>

<p>In many parts of the South crimson clover can be seeded in corn
stubble if an early variety of corn has been used. Although there
is some risk that the clover may not make enough growth before
winter if seeding is delayed until the corn is harvested, the danger
of losing the stand is not as great as if the clover were seeded
earlier, while the corn was standing.</p>

<p>Crimson clover is sometimes seeded after a grass or clover crop
if the rainfall in July is sufficient to cause the sod to decay. In
the far South it can be planted after peanuts, while in all sections
it can be sown as a catch crop on land where cotton or other crops
have died early in the season.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="REQUIREMENTS_FOR_OBTAINING_A_STAND" id="REQUIREMENTS_FOR_OBTAINING_A_STAND">REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING A STAND.</a></h2>


<p>Probably the difficulty most commonly experienced in growing
crimson clover is failure to obtain a satisfactory stand. Sometimes
the seed does not germinate well; more commonly good germination
is secured, but the seedlings wither and die before they can become
established. Frequently not more than 50 per cent of the plants
survive the first three weeks, while a complete failure of the crop is
a common risk even in the sections where crimson clover is most
widely grown.</p>

<p>The most common cause of failure to obtain a stand is hot, dry
weather after planting. The seedlings of crimson clover are tender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[ 9 ]</a></span>
succulent, and shallow rooted and are easily killed by lack of moisture.
Unfortunately, in most of the crimson-clover area the weather
during late August and early September is very likely to be hot and
droughty, making the planting of the clover at that time rather
hazardous. Some farmers attempt to avoid this difficulty by planting
either in early summer or in October, after the fall rains; there
is danger, however,
that the plants will
make too much or
too little growth to
survive the winter.
In the long run it is
probably better to
plant at the regular
time and depend
upon thorough preparation
of the seed
bed to offset any
deficiency in the
rainfall.</p>


<h3><a id="SOILS"></a>SOILS.</h3>

<p>Crimson clover
can be grown successfully
on almost any
type of soil if it is
reasonably rich, well
drained, and supplied
with organic
matter and the
proper inoculating
bacteria. Probably
two-thirds of the
crimson-clover acreage
is found on the
sandy soils of the
Atlantic Coastal
Plain, but the crop
is not necessarily restricted
to sandy
soils and is in fact
increasing in importance on the red-clay soils of the Piedmont region
and in the limestone valleys of Virginia and Tennessee.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 315px;"><a id="fig4"></a>
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="315" height="557" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;a crimson-clover failure on ground too poor in
humus.</div>
</div>

<p>Crimson clover has been an important factor in increasing yields
on soils that have been abused, but it is not a crop for land which is
naturally very poor. It does not do well on rough, newly cleared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10 ]</a></span>
areas, raw subsoil, Hard, dry clay, or sterile sand. (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4.</a>) For
such soils soy beans, cowpeas, and velvet beans are better suited and
should be used for the first three or four years until crimson clover
can be successfully grown. Crimson clover can be made to grow
on poor soils, provided they are specially prepared by liming, manuring,
and inoculating. In general, however, crimson clover is a crop
for maintaining soils which are already fairly productive rather
than one for inducing productivity in soils where it is quite lacking.
If there is any doubt whether the soil is suitable for crimson clover,
a small plat should be prepared under field conditions and planted
one year for trial.</p>


<h3><a id="PREPARATION"></a>PREPARATION OF THE SEED BED.</h3>

<p>To secure a full, even stand of crimson clover with any degree of
regularity the seed bed should be well and thoroughly prepared.
The soil should be firm, moist, well settled, and fine on top. Only
indifferent success can possibly be expected if the seed is scattered on
land which is loose, dry,
and full of hard lumps
and trash. A loose seed
bed dries out quickly,
heaves during the winter,
and on some soils blows
and washes badly.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;A corrugated roller or pulverizer, an excellent
implement for preparing the seed bed for
crimson clover.</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the
seed bed should not be
too hard, for although
this clover often grows
successfully on soil which
would be too solid for corn, there must be at| least enough loose soil on
the surface to cover the seed. Thorough preparation is the very best
insurance against failure of the stand through drought or winterkilling,
and the most successful growers sow crimson clover on land
as well prepared as that for wheat.</p>

<p>To secure a fine, firm seed bed without drying out the surface soil,
the land should be prepared with as few operations as possible. A
single working when the soil is in a moist, crumbly condition is
better than half a dozen workings when the soil is too wet or too
dry. In very sandy soils, or soils which do not form a crust, the
only preparation needed is to keep down the weeds.</p>

<p>An excellent tool for making the seed bed is the corrugated roller
or pulverizer (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>). This implement is an improvement over the
old plain roller for breaking clods and is unexcelled for keeping the
surface soil moist. It can be used after plowing and again before
planting, and even after planting if the soil needs to be compacted.
Rolling of some kind to firm the soil is especially important on sandy
soils, but it is equally beneficial on clay soils if they are cloddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11 ]</a></span></p>

<p>When clover is seeded in an intertilled crop, such as corn, cotton,
or tomatoes, the customary cultivation received by these crops is
ordinarily sufficient preparation for crimson clover. In sandy soil
the clover is often seeded without any immediate preparation, but a
light stirring with a harrow-toothed cultivator is desirable if the
ground is hard. If the clover is to be used for hay or seed, the preceding
crop should be laid by level rather than in ridges. This will
facilitate cutting the clover.</p>

<p>Where crimson clover is seeded after a crop of small grain, the
stubble should be plowed or disked as soon as possible after the
grain is cut. Stubble land dries out quickly, partly because the soil
is suddenly left bare and partly because of the drain on the soil
moisture by the crops of ragweed and other coarse-growing weeds
which always follow a grain crop. Unless the soil is cultivated at
once it becomes very difficult to obtain anything like an ideal seed
bed for crimson clover. This difficulty is usually more pronounced
after oats and barley than after rye and wheat. Ordinarily the best
practice is to disk the grain stubble within a week after harvest and
harrow every week, or at least after every rain, in order to settle the
ground, destroy the weeds, and assist in holding the moisture pending
the time of seeding the clover. Plowing the stubble is more expensive
than disking and requires that the ground be allowed to settle
for a month or six weeks in order to secure a firm seed bed. Plowing
is an advantage in a wet season, because plowed ground dries readily;
it is a disadvantage in a dry season for the same reason.</p>


<h3><a id="FERTILIZERS"></a>FERTILIZERS.</h3>

<p>On moderately rich soil the fertilizer applied to the preceding
crop is sufficient to produce a good crop of crimson clover. This is
especially true where the clover follows such crops as potatoes or
tomatoes, which ordinarily are heavily treated with fertilizers. It is
important to realize, however, that crimson clover has a very short
period of growth, and that to make a vigorous growth it must have a
good supply of plant food. On sandy soils where fertilizers have not
recently been applied it is often the practice to apply from 150 to 200
pounds of acid phosphate, with some potash fertilizer if it can be
afforded. On clay soils 200 or 300 pounds per acre of acid phosphate
ordinarily are sufficient. On many soils a light application of nitrate
of soda will assist materially in giving the young clover plants a
good start and often will enable them to withstand the effects of a
late drought or severe winter which otherwise might have injured
the stand. If the seeding has been delayed, as by waiting for suitable
rains, an application of not more than 75 pounds of nitrate of soda
per acre will stimulate the young plants and enable them to make a
better growth before winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Fertilizer is usually applied at seeding time, but a few farmers have
been found who apply it as a top-dressing very early the following
summer, giving as a reason that there is then no loss from winter
leaching and that by this method the plants are nourished at the
time they are making their most vigorous growth. Such top-dressings
of fertilizer should not be made while the leaves are wet with rain
or dew. Where stable manure is applied to crimson clover very
marked results follow. It may be spread just before seeding when
the clover is not grown in an intertilled crop, or it may be applied as
a top-dressing in winter or very early spring.</p>

<p>The more vigorous the growth that can be induced by the application
of suitable fertilizers the more marked will be the increase in
the yield of the succeeding crops. On soil in a low state of productivity
the use of a reasonable amount of fertilizer will often enable
a successful crop of clover and succeeding crops to be produced, where
had not the fertilizers been applied the clover would have failed.
Furthermore, the following crop, particularly if it be corn, would
also fail to give the increased yield which follows a successful stand
of crimson clover.</p>

<p>An application of barnyard manure will be found to be especially
effective in obtaining a stand of crimson clover on any thin, galled
spots in the field. The manure should be worked into the ground
before seeding, and, if possible, a second application as a top-dressing
should be given a day or two after planting. The top-dressing
stimulates the seedlings and if strawy helps to protect them from the
August sun.</p>


<h3><a id="LIME"></a>LIME.</h3>

<p>Crimson clover is not as dependent on lime as red clover and
alfalfa, being more like alsike clover in this respect. It does not
thrive on soils which are very "sour," but on well-drained soils in
a productive condition crimson clover frequently makes a vigorous
growth, even though the soil may show a high lime requirement.
The stands are usually more uniformly good over the limed parts
of such fields than on the unlimed parts, although it is sometimes
questionable whether the benefit derived from liming is profitable.
Liming is more often desirable on clay soils than on sandy soils,
and usually gives better results when used in conjunction with fertilizers
than when used alone. On light sandy soils deficient in humus
burnt lime may be actually injurious. In considering the advisability
of applying lime one must not lose sight of the need of lime on the
part of such other crops as corn, cantaloupes, or peaches, which
are either grown with or follow the clover. Inasmuch as the effect
of liming varies greatly in different localities, it is suggested that
small plats be treated experimentally at different rates before any
considerable areas are limed.</p>

<h3><a id="INOCULATION"></a>INOCULATION.</h3>

<p>A large part of the value of all clovers lies in their ability to
utilize the nitrogen of the air and add it to the soil. When
grown on rich land, the clovers, like many other plants, use the
nitrogen already present in the soil and are not stimulated to contribute
any to their own support or to the support of other crops.
To enable the clover to use the nitrogen in the air the presence of
the proper nodule-forming bacteria in the soil is necessary.</p>

<p>Fortunately, most of the soils in the crimson-clover sections appear
to be already inoculated, and artificial inoculation is not often
necessary, except on soils new to the crop. Crimson clover is inoculated
by the same strain of bacteria which occurs on the roots of
the other true clovers; consequently, a field which has produced a
good stand of red, mammoth, alsike, white, hop, Carolina, rabbit's-foot,
or buffalo clover is usually inoculated sufficiently for crimson
clover. Sweet clover, Japan clover, and bur clover are not true
clovers and are inoculated by a different strain of bacteria.</p>

<p>The importance of inoculation is well shown by an experiment
conducted by the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station. In
this experiment yields of 4,057 and 6,100 pounds of crimson-clover
hay were secured on inoculated soils, while on corresponding areas
which were not inoculated the yields were 761 pounds on one area
and nothing on the other.</p>

<p>The soil can be inoculated artificially by means of pure cultures
of the bacteria or by the transfer of a small quantity of soil from
another clover field.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The latter method is the more certain, but is
open to the danger of introducing noxious weeds, insects, and plant
diseases, especially if the soil is brought from a distance. The
presence of stem-rot in many sections makes the use of soil especially
dangerous. This disease can, be carried with the soil from field to
field.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Sufficient pure culture for inoculating seed for 1 acre can be secured free from the
United States Department of Agriculture. Full directions for using the culture accompany

<h2><a name="SEEDING" id="SEEDING">SEEDING.</a></h2>


<h3><a id="TIME_OF_SEEDING"></a>TIME OF SEEDING.</h3>

<p>Crimson clover is usually sown between August 15 and October 1,
the general rule being to plant about 60 days before the first killing
frost is expected. South of Virginia crimson clover can be seeded as
late as November 1, although if planted late more seed should be
used and a light dressing of nitrate of soda applied, in order to
stimulate the young plants. Seeding earlier than August 1 is seldom
advisable unless the crop is sown with some other crop the shade of
which will hold it back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The exact date of planting depends almost entirely upon the moisture
content of the soil. The principal condition to avoid is planting
when the soil contains just enough moisture to germinate the seeds,
but not enough to keep the plants growing. Usually it is better to
plant when the soil is quite dry than when it is slightly moist, for in
dry soil the seeds, if properly buried, lie without germinating and
are ready to grow vigorously at the first rainfall. The most favorable
time for seeding is just before or just after a good rain, when the
soil is moist enough to form a ball in the hand.</p>


<h3><a id="RATE_OF_SEEDING"></a>RATE OF SEEDING.</h3>

<p>The ordinary rate of seeding crimson clover is 15 pounds per acre,
although the rate varies according to conditions. From 12 to 15
pounds per acre are usually sufficient when growing the crop for seed
or when the soil is unusually rich. On poor soil, dry soil, or on soil
which has not previously produced crimson clover 18 to 22 pounds
of seed give better assurance of a stand. Heavy seeding is also desirable
when planting late in the season or when a heavy crop is
wanted for green manure early in the spring.</p>

<p>Theoretically, 2 pounds of seed per acre would provide six plants
for every square foot, which is a satisfactory stand. Under ordinary
circumstances, however, it is necessary to allow for some of the seed
being too deep, or too shallow, or failing to germinate, and for a
certain percentage of winterkilling. It is also well to have a fairly
thick stand of the young plants, so that the ground may be well
covered during the early fall and thus prevent soil washing and the
growth of winter weeds.</p>


<h3><a id="METHODS_OF_SEEDING"></a>METHODS OF SEEDING.</h3>

<p>The most common method of seeding crimson clover in intertilled
crops is to scatter the seed broadcast with a rotary seeder or by hand.
(<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6.</a>) In order to place the seed on a fresh, moist seed bed it is
commonly broadcasted immediately behind the cultivator at the last
cultivation and is covered 'at once by a second cultivator. In tall
corn the seed may be sown from horseback, the ears of the horse being
covered with small bags to prevent the entrance of the flying seed.
Slightly more seed is required when seeding in tall corn, as some seed
catches in the corn plants. When seeding in cotton care must be taken
to avoid injury to the opening bolls, which are easily knocked off or
torn. This is best done by seeding by hand, covering the seed with a
piece of brush dragged down the rows.</p>

<p>In low-growing truck crops and on fallow ground crimson clover
can be seeded with a wheelbarrow seeder. This implement distributes
the seed more evenly than can be done by hand or with the rotary
seeder, especially when planting a mixture of crops. The wheelbarrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15 ]</a></span>
seeder being somewhat awkward to handle is better adapted
to smooth, level fields than to hillsides.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 465px;"><a id="fig6"></a>
<img src="images/fig6.png" width="465" height="275" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Seeding crimson clover in corn at the last cultivation.</div>
</div>

<p>Probably the very best method of seeding crimson clover is with
the special clover or alfalfa drill. Where enough clover is grown
to warrant its use this implement is to be highly recommended. The
seed is sown in 4-inch rows at just the proper depth and with the
right pressure, and the fertilizer is placed exactly under each row,
where it will be immediately available to the seedlings. Drilled
clover requires less seed than broadcasted clover and produces a more
even and certain stand.</p>

<p>In place of the special clover drill an ordinary grain drill equipped
with a clover-seed attachment can be used with good results. Special
spouts should be arranged to lead from the clover-seed box back of
the shoes or disks, in order to deposit the seed directly in the furrow.
Chain furrow closers are best for covering the seed, as they leave
the furrows broad and flat instead of <b>V</b> shaped and lessen the danger
of the seedlings being covered with soil during a hard rain.</p>

<p>For use in intertilled crops there are several types of 1-row drills,
the best for this purpose being the 5-hoe drill equipped with press
wheels.</p>

<p>Crimson-clover seed must be covered, but not too deeply. In most
soils it is not enough to depend on rain to effect a covering. An inch
in sandy soils and half an inch in clay soils appear to be about the
right depth. Shallow planting gives the best results in wet seasons
and deep planting in time of drought. Broadcasted seed should be
covered with a spike-tooth harrow or a weeder rather than a heavy
harrow or a shovel cultivator. A harrow made of fairly stiff brush
is often useful in loose soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16 ]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="CHOICE_OF_SEED"></a>CHOICE OF SEED.</h3>

<p>As a rule, fresh crimson-clover seed is of good viability, and failure
to secure a stand is not often caused by failure of the seed to
grow. Unlike most clovers, crimson-clover seed absorbs water readily
and sprouts quickly. There are practically none of the hard
seeds which are so frequent in red clover and sweet clover, and a
germination of 90 per cent in 48 hour's is not uncommon. The seed
deteriorates rapidly, however, and when more than 2 years old rarely
shows a germination in excess of 50 per cent. Sometimes, when
stocks of commercial seed are low, old seed finds its way to the market,
and this, when planted, gives poor results. Old seed can usually be
detected by the dull-brown appearance of the seed coat as contrasted
with the bright, shiny, pinkish or greenish yellow color of fresh seed.
Brown seed, however, is sometimes caused by weathering during harvest,
and such seed is not objectionable unless the weathering has
been excessive.</p>

<p>A common impurity in crimson-clover seed is green, shrunken, and
immature seed, caused by harvesting the crop before it is ripe. Crimson-clover
seed does not germinate readily until it takes on a yellowish
tinge; therefore, green seed should be rejected.</p>

<p>Crimson-clover seed is larger and plumper than red-clover seed
and if properly cleaned should not contain seeds of dodder or the
smaller seeded weeds. Frequently, however, it does contain the seeds
of field peppergrass, yellow trefoil, evening primrose, sheep sorrel,
wild geranium, buttercups, mustards, and other weeds which blossom
in early summer.</p>


<h3><a id="UNHULLED"></a>UNHULLED SEED.</h3>

<p>There is a growing belief among farmers that they are less likely
to lose a stand of crimson clover through drought if they sow the seed
in the hull rather than use the hulled seed as it ordinarily appears on
the market. It is claimed that the hulls hold the moisture to some
extent and carry the seedlings over the critical day or two following
germination, while some farmers assert that the unhulled seeds require
more moisture for germination, and the seeds therefore do not sprout
until there is enough moisture in the soil to keep the plants growing.
Unhulled seed is bulky and is not often handled by commercial seedsmen,
although one large grower sells the unhulled seed in compressed,
bales similar to small cotton bales. It usually can be secured from
neighboring farmers, however, or is easily saved at home. The seed
can be harvested with a stripper from the standing crop in the field
or the mature crop can be cut and thrashed like an ordinary grain
crop. For local planting on a small scale unhulled seed is the
cheapest and most accessible form of crimson-clover seed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[ 17 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Unhulled seed is somewhat difficult to sow, because the hairy hulls
stick together in masses and can not be scattered uniformly. To
avoid this trouble the seed may be mixed with moistened earth or
with lime, or may be sown with a blower similar to those used on
small forges. A better plan is to sow on a windy day, throwing the
seed vertically into the air and allowing the wind to scatter it.</p>

<p>Of unhulled seed of the best quality, 100 pounds contains about 1
bushel (60 pounds) of clean seed. The common grades, however, are
usually more chaffy and require 120 to 180 pounds to make a bushel.
From 2 to 3 pounds of unhulled seed are therefore regarded as equivalent
to 1 pound of hulled seed. A bushel of unhulled seed, even when
well packed down, weighs only 6 to 10 pounds and contains about 4
pounds of seed. The appearance of both hulled and unhulled crimson-clover
seed is shown in <a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>.</p>

seed gathered with a homemade stripper. (Natural size.)</div>
</div>


<h3><a id="NURSE_CROP"></a>USE OF A NURSE CROP.</h3>

<p>In order to protect the crimson-clover seedlings from the hot sun
of late August it is a common practice in some sections to plant with
the clover a small quantity of some quick-growing crop like buckwheat,
cowpeas, rape, or turnips. A thin stand of these heavier
leaved plants furnishes an ideal shade for the young clover, and on
soils which are inclined to bake it prevents the formation of a crust.
The nurse crop must be seeded lightly, usually not more than half
the regular rate, as the ordinary stand shades the ground so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[ 18 ]</a></span>
completely as to destroy the crimson clover. On hot clay soil in the Piedmont
region the chances of obtaining a stand of clover are about
twice as good with a nurse crop as without one.</p>

<p>Buckwheat is the principal nurse crop northward from Washington,
D. C. A common rate of seeding is 2 to 3 pecks of buckwheat in
15 pounds of crimson clover. If the planting can be made in July
the buckwheat usually has time to ripen before frost and thus pay
the cost of starting both stands.</p>

<p>In the cotton belt cowpeas have been used successfully, especially
when seeding on fallow ground. They are seeded broadcast at the
rate of one-half bushel per acre. There is ordinarily not enough time
for the cowpeas to mature, but they add to the value of the stand for
fall pasturage and protect the clover from severe weather in the winter.
Both cowpeas and buckwheat have the merit of being able to
grow on poor soil.</p>

<p>Dwarf Essex rape has been used as a nurse crop in a few cases
where the clover was to be pastured by hogs or sheep in the fall.
From 2 to 3 pounds of rape, sown in August, furnishes sufficient
cover for a nurse crop. Cowhorn turnips, winter kale, and mustard
are also satisfactory nurse crops if planted at a rate not exceeding
1 pound of seed per acre. If the clover is to be saved for seed these
latter crops are objectionable, as a few plants will live over winter
and ripen at the same time as the clover.</p>

<p>Where a nurse crop can not be grown conveniently, the crimson-clover
seedlings can be protected from the sun by a light top-dressing
of straw, spread just after the seed is sown.</p>


<h3><a id="SEED_MIXTURES"></a>SEED MIXTURES.</h3>

<p>Crimson clover is frequently grown in combination with winter
grain, hairy vetch, or other forage crops having a similar period of
growth. The mixed crop is less liable to lodge than the single crop,
cures more readily in damp weather, and usually furnishes a heavier
yield. Another advantage of the mixed crop is that if either should
fail the other will serve as a cover crop during the winter and bring
some return the following spring. Mixed crops are not desirable
if the clover is to be saved for seed.</p>

<p>South of central Virginia crimson clover is usually grown in combination
with winter oats. An early variety of oats, such as the
Fulghum, or a late variety of clover, such as the white blooming, is
usually the best, as the oat crop matures somewhat later than the ordinary
crimson clover. The customary rate of seeding is 15 pounds
of the clover and 2&frac12; bushels of oats per acre. In Delaware and
eastern Maryland the most popular companion crop for crimson
clover is winter wheat, although barley makes a desirable hay crop
and is sometimes used. Eye is not desirable for hay, but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19 ]</a></span>
probably the best of the grains for green manure, as it is hardy, vigorous,
and starts growth early in the spring. Rye and wheat are seeded at
the rate of 1 bushel per acre with the customary quantity of crimson
clover. The accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>) shows a field seeded
to a mixture of crimson clover and wheat. Usually the grain is
well headed, but in the milk or soft-dough stage, when the clover is
ready to cut, the yield of the mixed crimson clover and grain
is often 25 to 50 per
cent greater than
that of the clover
alone.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 315px;"><a id="fig8"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Crimson clover and wheat in mixture. In the
foreground the crop has been cut and fed green to stock.
The remainder was cut the next day for hay. The grain
prevents the crimson clover from lodging.</div>
</div>

<p>Hairy vetch and
crimson clover are
sometimes grown together,
seeding at the
rate of 20 pounds
and 10 pounds per
acre, respectively.
As both these plants
are likely to lodge in
good soil, however,
one of the grains is
usually included, a
common seeding
mixture being oats 2
bushels, hairy vetch
12 to 15 pounds, and
crimson clover 5
pounds. Bur clover,
black medic, and
other winter-growing
legumes are
sometimes found in
mixtures with crimson
clover, although such mixtures generally occur by accident rather
than intent. Black medic and crimson clover make' a particularly
good combination on rich soil.</p>

<p>In most of the crimson-clover area the cultivated grasses, such as
timothy, redtop, and orchard grass, are not commonly grown. However,
where these grasses flourish they may well be seeded at the
same time as the crimson clover, provided the latter is planted not
earlier than September 15. In some sections Johnson grass and
Bermuda grass make useful combinations with crimson clover, the
grasses making most of their growth in the summer and the clover
in the fall and spring.</p>

<h2><a name="TREATMENT_OF_THE_STAND" id="TREATMENT_OF_THE_STAND">TREATMENT OF THE STAND.</a></h2>


<p>Ordinarily no special treatment is required after seeding and the
clover goes into the winter without any further handling. If the
growth is so rank that there is danger of the plants being too succulent
to survive the winter, the tops can be reduced by light grazing
with small animals, such as calves, sheep, or chickens, or by mowing
with the cutter bar of the mowing machine set high. If the stand is
backward, it may be stimulated by a light application of nitrate of
soda. It is said that a thin stand can be thickened by grazing lightly
with sheep, as the grazing induces heavier stooling. The aim should
be to carry the clover into the winter with well-hardened leafy stems
and with a well-established root system to withstand heaving out in
the spring.</p>

<p>In fields which are to be saved for seed a wise precaution is to go
over them early in the spring and chop out the weeds. If wild onion
and other weeds are chopped off in April, they do not make enough
growth by May to contaminate the seed crop.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="MALADIES" id="MALADIES">MALADIES.</a></h2>


<p>The only disease seriously affecting crimson clover is the clover
stem-rot, root-rot, or wilt, a disease resembling the stem-rot, or wilt,
of lettuce and other plants. This disease is prevalent in nearly all
the crimson-clover States and sometimes does considerable damage.
The stem-rot affects the clover at all seasons, but is more noticeable
in the spring, when it sometimes causes large spots of clover suddenly
to wilt and fall. Occasionally an entire field is affected, but
the disease is most prevalent in low, rich spots. Examination of the
plants discloses a rotting off or decay of the stems close to the ground,
followed immediately by the appearance on the stems of small black
lumps, or sclerotia, about the size of clover seed. These sclerotia are
a means of spreading the disease and are often harvested in the hay
or in the seed crop. The only known remedy for the stem-rot is to
cease growing clover or alfalfa on an infested field for three or four
years, substituting cowpeas or soy beans. Seed from fields known to
be infested should, of course, be avoided.</p>

<p>No insects are known to affect crimson clover seriously, nor are
weeds of great importance in clover planted on clean fields. When
planted in cultivated crops or in poorly prepared ground crimson
clover is often seriously damaged by a rank growth of chickweed,
knawel (moss weed), winter cress, and other winter-growing annuals.</p>
